            <div class="panel-text"><p>Hi! My name is Sparky! I'm a <strong>solar flare</strong>, which is a giant flash of light from the Sun. When the Sun's magnetic energy gets all tangled up and snaps like a rubber band, <em>FLASH</em>! A huge burst of energy is released, and that's me!</p></div>
        </div>

            <div class="panel-image"><img src="space_weather_friends.png" alt="Sparky with his space weather friends: solar wind and a CME"></div>
            <div class="panel-text"><p>I have friends called <strong>Coronal Mass Ejections</strong>, or CMEs. They are giant bubbles of solar gas that the Sun sometimes burps out. Together, we are all part of <strong>space weather</strong>. The Sun also sends out a constant stream of particles called the solar wind. When we all travel from the Sun, we can sometimes visit Earth!</p></div>

        <div class="story-panel panel-left">
            <div class="panel-image"><img src="sparky_journey.png" alt="Sparky zooming through space with determination"></div>
            <div class="panel-text"><p>One day, <em>SNAP</em>! I zoomed away from the Sun. Because I'm made of light, I travel at the speed of light‚Äîthe fastest speed in the universe! It only took me <strong>8 minutes</strong> to travel 93 million miles to reach that beautiful blue and green planet, Earth.</p></div>

            <div class="panel-image"><img src="sparky_astronaut.png" alt="Sparky passing by an astronaut in a spaceship"></div>
            <div class="panel-text"><p>As I got close, I zipped past astronauts floating in space. They wear special spacesuits to protect them. Earth's air protects people on the ground, but my energy can be a little strong for astronauts and their spaceships, so they have to be extra careful when a big flare like me comes along.</p></div>

             <div class="panel-image"><img src="satellite_disruption.png" alt="Illustration of satellites experiencing disruption from space weather effects"></div>
             <div class="panel-text"><p>On my journey, I saw a shiny satellite floating all alone. Satellites help us talk on the phone, watch TV, and find our way with GPS. But my super-fast energy can sometimes make satellites feel a little dizzy, messing up their electronics and making the GPS signals wobbly for a short time!</p></div>

        <div class="story-panel panel-right">
            <div class="panel-image"><img src="sparky_aurora.png" alt="Sparky creating a beautiful aurora for a photographer"></div>
            <div class="panel-text"><p>While I can cause some little hiccups, my CME friends are the real artists! When their bubble of solar stuff reaches Earth, it creates beautiful dancing lights in the sky called the <strong>aurora</strong>. The colors come from the particles hitting different gases: oxygen makes green lights, and nitrogen makes purple and blue ones!</p></div>

        <div class="story-panel panel-left">
            <div class="panel-image"><img src="sparky_power_grid.png" alt="Sparky causing alerts on a power grid operator's screen"></div>
            <div class="panel-text"><p>A really big CME can give Earth's magnetic shield a big shake! This can sometimes cause problems for the power lines on the ground and even make the lights go out. But don't worry, smart scientists called space weather forecasters are always watching the Sun to give a warning and keep the power safe!</p></div>
